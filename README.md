# Assessment

README for Statement 2
==================================

Overview:
---------
'Text_Analysis_(1).ipynb' is a Jupyter notebook designed for conducting text analysis through natural language processing (NLP). The notebook includes steps for preprocessing text data, possibly analyzing topics, generating word clouds, and visualizing data. It utilizes several Python libraries such as gensim, nltk, pyLDAvis, and others for in-depth text analysis and visualization.

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, gensim, nltk, pyLDAvis, matplotlib, wordcloud

Installation:
-------------
1. Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

During the first run of the notebook, ensure that the nltk stopwords are downloaded as instructed in the first code cell.

Usage:
------
1. Clone or download 'Text_Analysis_(1).ipynb' to your local machine.
2. Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment.
3. Execute the cells sequentially, from importing libraries and downloading necessary nltk resources to processing and analyzing the text data.


README For Statement 3
for auto_merging.ipynb
=============================

Overview:
---------
This Jupyter notebook is designed for the purpose of automatically processing documents. It begins with a step to load documents from a specified directory and includes further functionality for analyzing, merging, or otherwise manipulating these documents. 

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment
- llamacore library (for document loading and processing)

Installation:
-------------
Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed on your system. You can then install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install (required packages)


------
1. Place the documents you wish to process in a directory named './documents' relative to the notebook's location.
2. Open the 'auto_merging.ipynb' notebook in your Jupyter environment.
3. Execute the cells in order, following any instructions provided within the notebook for custom configurations or additional steps.
4. The notebook will load and process the documents, with further actions and outputs depending on its coded functionalities.



Multi_agent.ipynb
=============================

Overview:
---------
'Multi_agent.ipynb' is a Jupyter notebook designed for operations involving multi-agent systems, 
potentially including tasks such as document processing, indexing, and interactions with AI models, 
particularly with OpenAI's APIs. 

Requirements:
-------------
Install all the dependecies and libraries from the requirements.txt file
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment
- Various Python packages including 'dotenv', 'llama_index', and potentially others for AI interactions (e.g., OpenAI's Python SDK)

Installation:
-------------
1. Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

Adjust the installation command based on the actual dependencies used within the notebook.

Usage:
------
1. Clone or download 'Multi_agent.ipynb' to your local machine.
2. Place any required environment variables in a `.env` file located in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially. You may need to configure certain cells based on your specific requirements or environment setup.
4. The notebook's operations include document indexing, environmental setup, and possibly communicating with AI models or APIs.
